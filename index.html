      <p>Hey,</p>
      <p>
        It feels like forever since I last saw you or talked to you, except for those brief moments when I look at your photos in my private album. I thought that by keeping my distance, by not talking to you or seeing you, it would make things easier for both of us—especially for me. But instead, I find myself thinking about you even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day, I wonder what you’re up to, how you’re doing. I can’t help but hope that, maybe even just for a second, I cross your mind too. I know it’s possible that I don’t, but the thought of you is always with me. I’ve tried my best not to bother you, not to let my feelings get in the way. But no matter how hard I try, I still miss you. I still think about you all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lately, I’ve been seeing you in my dreams constantly. Every time I wake up, there’s this strong urge to message you, to ask if we can meet. But then, I stop myself because I don’t know what will happen if I do. I don’t even know what I would say or what I would ask. All I know is that I miss you, and I want to be close to you again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we stopped talking, you’ve been on my mind constantly. Whether I’m at home, or even just sitting alone, you’re always there in my thoughts. It’s like you’ve become a part of me, and no matter what I do, I can’t shake the feeling that something is missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I keep asking myself—if we know something is out of reach, should we just stop trying? Should we let go without even giving it a real chance? I can’t bring myself to do that. I can’t just walk away from something that means so much to me. Why should we leave things unfinished, unspoken? This isn’t what I wanted for us. When I think about your messages, about the way things used to be, I’m left feeling so confused and lost. "Why is this happening? Why are we letting this happen?"
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ve always been special to me. From the very beginning, you’ve had a place in my heart that no one else could fill. And that hasn’t changed. You’re still special to me now, and you always will be, no matter what happens between us. I don’t know what the future holds, but I do know that I’ll always care about you. I’ll always be here for you, no matter what.
